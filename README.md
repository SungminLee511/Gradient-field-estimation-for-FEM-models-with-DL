# Gradient-field-estimation-for-FEM-models-with-DL

Estimating target field gradients on FE mesh models, with edge-wise laplacian coordinates and globally inducted input data with post process losses such as element-wise curl vector norm, element wise stress tensor etc.

Experiments done on SimJEB Jet Engine Bracket Dataset.
